    "* Escape characters are special characters used in programming to represent characters that are difficult or impossible to type or display directly. They are represented by a backslash followed by a character or a sequence of characters. They are used to represent special characters with special meanings in the programming language, non-printable characters, or characters that are difficult to type. To use an escape character, you simply include it in a string or character literal by preceding it with a backslash."
